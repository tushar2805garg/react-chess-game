Project is live at: https://play-chess-online.herokuapp.com/
1.	I have created a two player chess game which you can play with anyone from anywhere in the world . All it needs is just a proper internet connection 
2.	2.	On the home page there are two buttons namely as: Create , Join button.You can either create a room and share with whom you wants to play or can play by joining someones other room
3.	3.	I have used Pubnub Api to publish moves to opponents board which works with latency of less than 100ms.
4.	5.	Whenever you make a wrong move I display a message there for which I use  sweetalert and displayed message is based upon its your opponents turn and why are you making a move or you cannot place a piece at a particular position because that piece cannot move there
5.	6.	 There is also a time limit of 1 min within which you have to make a move otherwise you lose the game.
